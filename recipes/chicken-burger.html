        <h1>Chicken Burger Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../img/chicken-burger.jpg" alt="chicken burger photo" class="content-photo">
        <p>Chicken burgers get a bad rap. They often get left in the dust by other burger alternatives like salmon, turkey, and veggies. While they can definitely be a tad bit lean, it does not automatically lead to a boring burger!</p>
        <p>The trick to cooking a good chicken burger is watching the cook time: they can go from juicy to bone dry quickly once overcooked. They should take about 4 to 5 minutes per side, but there are a lot of factors that lead to different cook times: whether you're cooking on a gas stove or grill, what kind of pan you're using and how well it conducts heat, and how cold your patty was when it hit the pan. Given all of these variables, we think the best way to determine doneness is by using an instant-read meat thermometer: check that the center of the burger reaches 165ºF, which is the USDA's recommended temperature for poultry.</p>
        <p>To spice things up a bit, these chicken patties are seasoned with smoked paprika and loaded with crunchy, bright coleslaw to really give beef burgers a run for their money. We then top 'em with creamy avocado slices, spicy fresh red onion, and cheddar and jalapeño before sandwiching all of it between buttery brioche buns for the ultimate bite. Serve them up along some grilled potatoes for a lighter alternative to french fries or with a bright tomato-avocado salad.</p>
