        <h1>Green Salad Recipe</h1>

        <p>Well, let me introduce you to my favorite green salad recipe. It's simple, but it doesn't skimp at all on texture or flavor. I toss in Parmesan cheese for nutty, salty flavor, and tamari roasted almonds for crunch. To bring it all together, I drizzle on my go-to lemon vinaigrette. It makes this salad zingy, bright, and oh-so-versatile. It pairs just as nicely with pasta as it does with a veggie burger, and it tastes great with classic brunch fare too. If you need a last-minute side dish to round out your Easter menu this weekend, this green salad would be perfect.</p>
